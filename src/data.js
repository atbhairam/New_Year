You are not just a friend,
you are the reason behind
so many smiles and little cute moments.

I may not be perfect,
but I promise one thing
whenever you share a wish,
a dream, or even a silly thought,
I will always try my best
to be there for you.

Best of luck for your new job and journey. Proud of you girl you're the best best bestest.

Note: Jab bhi gift dene ka mann ho RCB ki t-shirt de dena bindass haha!!

Thank you for being you.
Merry Christmas and New Year ❤️🎄`;
